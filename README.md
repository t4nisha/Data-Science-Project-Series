Objective:
This project aims to predict future stock prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical stock market data, we seek to develop predictive models that can forecast stock prices accurately.

Problem Statement:
Predicting stock prices is a challenging task due to the inherent volatility and complexity of financial markets. However, accurate forecasts can provide valuable insights for investors, traders, and financial institutions, helping them make informed decisions and optimize their investment strategies.

Dataset:
We utilize a comprehensive dataset of historical stock prices obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisandresgarcia/stock-market-prediction. The dataset contains features such as opening price, closing price, high price, low price, volume traded, and other relevant metrics for a range of stocks.

Approach:
The project follows a two-fold approach:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We perform EDA to gain insights into the structure and characteristics of the stock market dataset. Through visualizations and statistical analyses, we aim to understand trends, patterns, and relationships within the data.
2. Predictive Modeling: We employ machine learning techniques, including regression models, to forecast future stock prices based on historical data. By training and evaluating predictive models, we aim to develop accurate and reliable forecasting models.
